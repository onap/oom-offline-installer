      "message": "I did investigate on this crap, here\u0027s what i found: This is due to a bug in module that causes it to not to be idempotent:\n\nhttps://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/51429\nhttps://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/51473\n\nIt was fixed as a result of the last pull in devel for release in Ansible 2.8. \n\nBUT it was also backported to the version we use: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/52024\n\nNow, why it\u0027s still reporting \u0027changed\u0027 is unknown to me, any idea? I tested with ansible 2.7.10 to no avail.\n\nTwo scenarios: we wait for ansible 2.8 in hope it helps OR we add this \u0027changed_when\u0027 thing or whatever to supress it.",
