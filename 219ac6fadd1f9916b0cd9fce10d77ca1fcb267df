      "message": "But what is the reason to create another variable \"additional_helm_override_files\" as there is already the \"helm_over(r)ide_file\" array where should be placed all override files and does not matter if it\u0027s the one with our own certificate or what. In the helm_override_files should be list of all files needed (e.g. onap/resources/overrides/onap-all.yaml; onap/resources/overrides/environment.yaml; onap/resources/overrides/openstack.yaml etc.). Just need to be careful about the path...",
