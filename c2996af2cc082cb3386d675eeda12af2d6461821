      "message": "I decided to remove this line.\nReason: the only thing it does is ensuring container being removed on stop, however we don\u0027t actually do it anywhere else explicitly, so I don\u0027t see it causing problems.\nNamely rancher server itself is not running with --rm. why this one should?\nOf course what caused this line to be removed was the fact that python-docker in the version shipped in rhel does not support auto_remove. It is easier to remove the line if it is not really needed, than\nto upgrade python-docker to newer version, especially that this updating code was removed.",
