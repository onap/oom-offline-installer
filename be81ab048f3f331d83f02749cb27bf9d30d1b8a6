      "message": "I think so, just the next paragraph is explaining it more - it is enough for me, maybe someone sees it differently though - if you suggest better sentence, then I may create a new patchset\n\nthe problem is that the theory is clear (for me at least), but we dont follow it in the practice - there are occurences of ansible_host, where cluster_ip should be, so I am explaining something what may not be true and reflected in the codebase...every test is done on a simple vm with one interface, maybe if someone would try to create more sophisticated setup, then those places in the code would become more obvious",
