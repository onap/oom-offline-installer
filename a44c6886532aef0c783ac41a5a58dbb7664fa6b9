      "message": "having handler for starting \"dns container\" sounds a bit strange to me. It sounds like just one time operation, not something we need to have in handler for repeatable task. Wouldn\u0027t be better to remove that \"handler\" and add just task instead of this handler logic ? I also did not find any other place in the code from where this handler is called",
