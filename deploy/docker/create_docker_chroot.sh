NAME:
    ${CMD} - create a chroot directory from docker image

DESCRIPTION:
    It will export docker image into a directory capable of chrooting.
    It needs and will run these commands (requires docker service):
        docker create
        docker export

USAGE:
    ${CMD} [-h|--help|help]
        This help

    ${CMD} convert <docker-name> <name-of-directory>

        It will convert docker image into directory - no chroot yet.
        The name of the docker image must be imported already (not a file):
            docker image ls

        The directory will be created and so this command will fail if some
        directory or a file of this name (filepath) already exists!
        There is another script run_chroot.sh with which you can do chroot
        on this newly created directory - so it is expected that this
        directory is kept clean and as it is.
        If you don't care about this feature (run_chroot.sh) and you know
        what are you doing, then do necessary mounts and execute:
            chroot <name-of-directory>/chroot /bin/sh -l
"

**Don't modify insides of this directory (where this README.md lies).**

The structure is needed as it is.

If you wish to just run chroot by yourself, you can do:
${md_codequote}
chroot ./chroot /bin/sh -l
${md_codequote}
