If we want to have real interoperability between distros of various kind let\u0027s implement it for real straight from the beginning and do not only pretend that we actually do. \n\nThe first task will fail as in Debian like distros the actual dir is \"/etc/ca-certificates\".\n\nI say we either support both Debian/RedHat role wide or we actually do not and not pretend in single tasks that we do.",

It was an ad hoc addition to just underline this is really a OS specific.\nShould be handled anyway completely different way when really doing the other OS supports.\n\nWill remove it completely as don\u0027t want to copy same condition to other task or make block of this now.",
