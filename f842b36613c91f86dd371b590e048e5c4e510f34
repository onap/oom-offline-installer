      "message": "Hmm... I know that this is not really changed compared to the old build script, but #!/usr/bin/env bash will certainly work, however is there any linux distro not putting bash in /bin? In fact new linux distros often symlink /bin to /usr/bin. Even if not symlinked, bash should be traditionally in /bin, unless you know any exception. On the other hand not quite sure if you can trust env being in /usr/bin.\np.s. sorry for commenting in separate replies, it is just new comments popping up in my head.",
