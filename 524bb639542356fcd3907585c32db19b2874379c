      "message": "Well in the start of the project you commented that default values should be in role defaults, and this is one of many corrections to that direction :)\n\nFor now my purpose was really testability as role is easier to test when reasonable defaults are defined instead of the need to define them in caller (in this case molecule.yml).\n\nI\u0027m the anti copy-paste fanatic and admit that my heart is bleeding out to copy same rows here:/ And in case of this role there are many variables.\nSo I\u0027m not sure how to deal with this mentally:)\n\nAs in the other hand group_vars should have most of them for documentation purposes better visible for user.\nApplication role has many variables that user may want to modify.",
