Other option is to have some boolean value \"patching_onap_values.yaml\" or later \"patching_robot_values.yaml\" and default False ...\nSetting-up all OOM parameters is most likely not in scope of offline installer so maybe we should remove this templating or have it possible just for some cases ?",
