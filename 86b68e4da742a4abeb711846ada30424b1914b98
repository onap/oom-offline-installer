      "message": "If I understood correctly then you DO use rke for ssh - it is in the cluster.yml (user: rke) - the reason for this artificial user was that on the CentOS/RHEL 7 ssh local-forwarding does not work for root - so rke is using unprivileged user for that. You are running rke up as root (or another ansible user) but the rke is internally using rke user for ssh and distribution its artefacts - so what was actually achieved with this change? Am I wrong? Please, correct me.",

      "message": "Yes, the intention is for rke to run as root, but to ssh to stuff as rke. I left the rke user on infra mainly because we may want/will want? to move for example control plane to infra, so it will just work without having to do some unusual things.\nAs for why you would run rke as root: I believe we are not testing offline installer running as different users with become: yes, but we really shouldn\u0027t block this usage. In that case using become like in previous patchsets would introduce another hidden requirement that the user that ansible connects as must have sudo rights for root and also for rke, without a password. Another way would be to use sudo from root context, but that seems a bad idea/bad practice. So the most clean way to handle this was to just run rke as root, and create the rke user mostly just to distribute ssh keys and in case some components would be moved to infra. Also it would be consistent with all other roles that run everything as root (helm/etc).",

I assumed it is better not to introduce additional problems because of rbac, and\n2. using rbac would require modifications to helm init usage, you would need a service account for helm, I once tried that when I was playing with kubeadm long ago (amsterdam times) and it needed permissions that it did not have by default. So using none here was just easier than doing more extensive changes (at least for this initial release of rke role).",
