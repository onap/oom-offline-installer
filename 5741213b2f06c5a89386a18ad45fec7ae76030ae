Quoting upstream docs: \n\n\"The cleanup playbook is for cleaning up test infrastructure that may not be present on the instance that will be destroyed. The primary use-case is for “cleaning up” changes that were made outside of Molecule’s test environment.\"\n\nI\u0027d rather pick destroy.yml for that.  You\u0027re playing on \u0027all\u0027 hosts which are molecule created hosts, which conflicts with the beforementioned manual excerpt.",

      "message": "Well, destroy.yml is described as something that runs outside of the hosts, because it is destroying them.\nSo I couldn\u0027t unmount anything from there. cleanup.yml was described in an unclear way and this description really suggests it is also running outside. However, it is opposed to the prepare.yml playbook, and prepare.yml is running inside, so I assumed this one also is. I believe i am correct.\nAlso note destroy.yml is provided by molecule and cannot be... \"subclassed\".",
