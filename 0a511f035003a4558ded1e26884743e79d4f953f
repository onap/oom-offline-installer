      "message": "I said many times that I am novice to ansible, so I am confused where is the line for config run or what is hardwired - you moved this var from top level file deep and down here - I am not saying that it is right or wrong, I am just curious if this correct ansible way - if we add a new file firewall-enable does that mean that user must go deep down the role files and change this var here? Or this can be set elsewhere in the top level - the file which is exposed to user every time - hosts or group_var something - so should not be there from start?",

      "message": "Default value is just it - a default value. You define it to eliminate the need to apply dirty conditionals like \"{var} is defined\" in tasks. Once var is assigned a default value you can be sure it won\u0027t be undefined and won\u0027t cause play to crash under certain circumstances.\n\nIf we add firewall-enable.yml then the user which wants it to be played has to override it in his favourite way: cmd line, group_vars, @settings_file. No need to modify defaults!",
