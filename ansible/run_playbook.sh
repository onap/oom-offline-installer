NAME:
    ${script_name} - wrapper for ansible-playbook command

DESCRIPTION:
    Run ansible playbook (or other command if it is there) inside a docker
    container or a chroot environment.

    By default the chroot is used because it has less dependencies and no
    service needs to be run (provided that chroot command is installed).

    Docker support is kept for compatibility reasons.

    To run ansible docker image you must set environment variable:
        ANSIBLE_DOCKER_IMAGE

    So this wrapper can know by which name you have built the included
    Dockerfile and also to trigger this different behaviour.

    For example:
        ANSIBLE_DOCKER_IMAGE=ansible

USAGE:
    ./${script_name}
        This help

    ./${script_name} <args>
        Run ansible-playbook command inside a chroot

    ANSIBLE_DOCKER_IMAGE=<docker-image> ./${script_name} <args>
        Run ansible-playbook command inside a docker container

REQUIREMENTS:
    For the optimal usage your system should support overlay mount. Which
    should be available on any recent kernel at least couple of years back.

    Another requirement is the 'unshare' utility which is part of 'util-linux'
    package and also is part of system for couple of years already.

    The last is 'chroot' command itself and that is also part of system
    basically everywhere.
