# Master playbook to run offline installer.
# Run this playbook e.g. with command: ./run_playbook.sh -e @application/application_configuration.yml site.yml
#

# the setup.yml playbook is excluded from this list for the following reasons:
# 1. setup.yml playbook requires either already deployed ssh key or
#    --ask-pass argument to interactively distribute a new key, which may
#    be a redundant effort if you already secured passwordless login
# 2. Also, the setup.yml playbook is not mandatory and can be replaced with
#    manual or semi-manual steps with ssh-copy-id command or other
# 3. playbooks here are more or less batch jobs and the ssh authentication
#    is a precondition, which should be done during configuration of the
#    installer
