# Wrapper to pass through following variables:
#   resources_source_host
#   resources_dir
#   resource_source_filename
#   resource_destination_directory
# and handle target directory creation and eventual removal on failure.
# Idempotence is also handled here as nothing is done if resource_destination_directory
# was already created.
#
# Logically also tranport method selection belongs to here but left it to caller
# as this is called in a loop causing "package_facts" called many times
# (not sure if it would matter).
