With this included here you a side effects can happen.\n\nWhile i understand inclusion of \u0027prepare-docker\u0027 here due to it\u0027s design, why it\u0027s the case with \u0027prepare-common\u0027?\n\nI\u0027m hesitating between -1 on this or leaving it for improvement is separate commit.",

      "message": "Ok i just realized why are we having test failing due to linting issues in _molecule_internal_role_, not oom tested role - it\u0027s because of this inclusion. So far we did nowhere came upon issues with linting prepare-docker role because natively it\u0027s out of scope of tested roles, and once you included it here it is... And that is the reason for https://jira.onap.org/browse/OOM-1850 And another reason for what i wrote above - molecule roles should not be put into test scope.",
