I am no spaces vs tabs zealot - although I use spaces exclusively for sanity but this indent issues with heredoc is elsewhere too in the code - frankly I dont see reason to refactor this file with tabs (to match the indent with the rest of the file) and leave other files as they are - or worse mix it up",

I tried at least support the others in the commit by simply flushing all the firewall rules.
