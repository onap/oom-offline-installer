      "message": "I use spaces :) that trick works only with tabs it would messed up the whole file or whole file must be refactored. I am no spaces vs tabs zealot - although I use spaces exclusively for sanity but this indent issues with heredoc is elsewhere too in the code - frankly I dont see reason to refactor this file with tabs (to match the indent with the rest of the file) and leave other files as they are - or worse mix it up",

I tried at least support the others in the commit by simply flushing all the firewall rules. Rhel/centos use firewalld, ubuntu ufw or similar - debian has no preference and I personally use simple iptables with it - and actually I would prefer iptables-persistent across the board because each and every of these \"firewalls\" are just wrappers with their own configs which generates at the end just iptables rules...",
