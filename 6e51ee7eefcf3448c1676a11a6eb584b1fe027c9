From UX perspective this parameter (if by default disabled) can easily trigger that someone will forget to fill it and create package w/o helm charts. All of that just because we would like to support deployment w/o helm charts. What about by default having it enabled with some \"to be filled value\" or even keep this file unchanged or just with small update of description.",
