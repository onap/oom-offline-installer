Or does this work also when normal plain helm used?\n- Can this be used also with minikube?\n\nPlease do not just answer my comment, but directly improve the describtion part if feasible.",

      "message": "@Samuli sorry :) I can improve the description, but this script is part of offline-installer and that is part of OOM and OOM uses that helm deploy plugin. That means that this script is not intended to be used outside of these constraints - it is just a tool to heal not so healthy ONAP installation. So to answer your question - as of now, this tool relies on that plugin.\n\nI will soon dig deeper to that deploy plugin and I left myself some TODOs in this script to deal with it - so in the future it can be used outside of ONAP and OOM, but then again - why would anyone want to use it? This script is just a band aid for broken ONAP installation.",
