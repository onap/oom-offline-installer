      "message": "N/A is universally known as Not Applicable, it can confuse an automatic tool about the same as that commit ref, but removing this label completely can confuse already existing automatic tool - in another words - existing environment is unaffected - this change only brings new usage outside of the git repo - if the label has no real usage and actually breaks something it can be removed in the future - as of now this change only improves user experience",
