      "message": "Tested it was, but not with our installer - I had to tell ansible where module is - what error we are talking about?\n\nThe previous version was not robust at all - it could only add to the list or create a new list at the top-level object. This is much more flexible.\n\nFor replace - it clould be changed to append but I made this decision for obvious reasons - we wwant tot fake dns right? So we dont want to add another nameserever because than we dont have certainty that our fake dns resolving will work.",
