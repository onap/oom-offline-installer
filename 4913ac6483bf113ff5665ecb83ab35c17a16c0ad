      "message": "Why have you used \"command\" if there is native ansible module \u0027yum\u0027, it has \u0027update_cache\u0027 opt.\n\nSecondly patch above is a workaround not solution for the real problem which is corrupted resources files. I think we need to further improve resource uploading to be a tansactional and atomic operation with all files not being corrupted as a prereq for successfull transaction \u0027commit\u0027. Why did problem described in OOM-1689 occur? Some upload process automation issue? Disk issue?",
