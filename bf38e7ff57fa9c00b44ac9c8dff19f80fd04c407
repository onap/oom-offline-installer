      "message": "here, I realized that I made a mistake - and it is quite important information - because in the upload-resources playbook - infra will initiate ssh connection to resource-host to download resources - and we again are using here a ansible_host - is it wrong? I dunno, but we have now one ip address which must be reacheable from install-server and infra-server, both of which can be on a different network",

      "message": "OK, no, I am taking this back - actually, both the resource-host and infra-node has ansible_host so we can expect that those ips are on the same network and they can communicate on that interface just fine - it would have been very strange setup if every kubernetes node had been on a different subnet and we cannot cater for every possible configuration",
